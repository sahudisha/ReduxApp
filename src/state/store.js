This relies on module resolution rules:
If you just give './action-creators', Node/webpack/Vite will automatically look for: 
    ./action-creators.js
    ./action-creators/index.js
So if thereâ€™s an index.js inside the action-creators folder, it works the same as writing ./action-creators/index. */

import combineReducers from "./reducers/index";

export const store = legacy_createStore(combineReducers, {}, applyMiddleware(thunk))
